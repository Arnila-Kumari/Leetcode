Can you solve this real interview question? Remove Covered Intervals - Given an array intervals where intervals[i] = [li, ri] represent the interval [li, ri), remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

The interval [a, b) is covered by the interval [c, d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.

Return the number of remaining intervals.

 

Example 1:


Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.


Example 2:


Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= li < ri <= 105
 * All the given intervals are unique.
