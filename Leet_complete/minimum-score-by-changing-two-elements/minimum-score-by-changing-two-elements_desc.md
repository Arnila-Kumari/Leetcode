Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Score by Changing Two Elements - You are given an integer array nums.

 * The low score of nums is the minimum absolute difference between any two integers.
 * The high score of nums is the maximum absolute difference between any two integers.
 * The score of nums is the sum of the high and low scores.

Return the minimum score after changing two elements of nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,7,8,5]

Output: 3

Explanation:

 * Change nums[0] and nums[1] to be 6 so that nums becomes [6,6,7,8,5].
 * The low score is the minimum absolute difference: |6 - 6| = 0.
 * The high score is the maximum absolute difference: |8 - 5| = 3.
 * The sum of high and low score is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,3]

Output: 0

Explanation:

 * Change nums[1] and nums[2] to 1 so that nums becomes [1,1,1].
 * The sum of maximum absolute difference and minimum absolute difference is 0.

 

Constraints:

 * 3 <= nums.length <= 105
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
