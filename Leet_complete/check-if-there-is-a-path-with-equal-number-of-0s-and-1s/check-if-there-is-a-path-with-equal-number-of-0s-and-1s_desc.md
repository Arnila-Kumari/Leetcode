Can you solve this real interview question? Check if There is a Path With Equal Number of 0's And 1's - You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid. You can move from a cell (row, col) to any of the cells (row + 1, col) or (row, col + 1).

Return true if there is a path from (0, 0) to (m - 1, n - 1) that visits an equal number of 0's and 1's. Otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: The path colored in blue in the above diagram is a valid path because we have 3 cells with a value of 1 and 3 with a value of 0. Since there is a valid path, we return true.


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: grid = [[1,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path in this grid with an equal number of 0's and 1's.


 

Constraints:

 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 2 <= m, n <= 100
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
