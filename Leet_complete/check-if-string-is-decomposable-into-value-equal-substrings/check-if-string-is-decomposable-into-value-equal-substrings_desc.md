Can you solve this real interview question? Check if String Is Decomposable Into Value-Equal Substrings - A value-equal string is a string where all characters are the same.

 * For example, "1111" and "33" are value-equal strings.
 * In contrast, "123" is not a value-equal string.

Given a digit string s, decompose the string into some number of consecutive value-equal substrings where exactly one substring has a length of 2 and the remaining substrings have a length of 3.

Return true if you can decompose s according to the above rules. Otherwise, return false.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = "000111000"
Output: false
Explanation: s cannot be decomposed according to the rules because ["000", "111", "000"] does not have a substring of length 2.


Example 2:


Input: s = "00011111222"
Output: true
Explanation: s can be decomposed into ["000", "111", "11", "222"].


Example 3:


Input: s = "011100022233"
Output: false
Explanation: s cannot be decomposed according to the rules because of the first '0'.


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * s consists of only digits '0' through '9'.
