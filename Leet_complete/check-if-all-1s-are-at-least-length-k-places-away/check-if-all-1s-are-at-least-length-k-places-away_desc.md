Can you solve this real interview question? Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away - Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 * 0 <= k <= nums.length
 * nums[i] is 0 or 1
