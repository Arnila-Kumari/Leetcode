Can you solve this real interview question? Sum of Consecutive Subsequences - We call an array arr of length n consecutive if one of the following holds:

 * arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 1 for all 1 <= i < n.
 * arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == -1 for all 1 <= i < n.

The value of an array is the sum of its elements.

For example, [3, 4, 5] is a consecutive array of value 12 and [9, 8] is another of value 17. While [3, 4, 3] and [8, 6] are not consecutive.

Given an array of integers nums, return the sum of the values of all consecutive non-empty subsequences.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that an array of length 1 is also considered consecutive.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The consecutive subsequences are: [1], [2], [1, 2].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,3]

Output: 31

Explanation:

The consecutive subsequences are: [1], [4], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 3], [1, 2, 3].

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
