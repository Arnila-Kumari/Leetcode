Can you solve this real interview question? Maximal Square - Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1


Example 3:


Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0


 

Constraints:

 * m == matrix.length
 * n == matrix[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 300
 * matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
