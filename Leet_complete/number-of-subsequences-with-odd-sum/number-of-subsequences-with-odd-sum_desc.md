Can you solve this real interview question? Number of Subsequences with Odd Sum - Given an array nums, return the number of subsequences with an odd sum of elements.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The odd-sum subsequences are: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The odd-sum subsequences are: [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2].

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
