Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Unlocked Indices to Sort Nums - You are given an array nums consisting of integers between 1 and 3, and a binary array locked of the same size.

We consider nums sortable if it can be sorted using adjacent swaps, where a swap between two indices i and i + 1 is allowed if nums[i] - nums[i + 1] == 1 and locked[i] == 0.

In one operation, you can unlock any index i by setting locked[i] to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make nums sortable. If it is not possible to make nums sortable, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3,2], locked = [1,0,1,1,0,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:

We can sort nums using the following swaps:

 * swap indices 1 with 2
 * swap indices 4 with 5

So, there is no need to unlock any index.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,1,3,2,2], locked = [1,0,1,1,0,1,0]

Output: 2

Explanation:

If we unlock indices 2 and 5, we can sort nums using the following swaps:

 * swap indices 1 with 2
 * swap indices 2 with 3
 * swap indices 4 with 5
 * swap indices 5 with 6

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3,2,1], locked = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Output: -1

Explanation:

Even if all indices are unlocked, it can be shown that nums is not sortable.

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 3
 * locked.length == nums.length
 * 0 <= locked[i] <= 1
