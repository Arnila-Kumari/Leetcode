Can you solve this real interview question? Game of Nim - Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with Alice starting first.

In this game, there are n piles of stones. On each player's turn, the player should remove any positive number of stones from a non-empty pile of his or her choice. The first player who cannot make a move loses, and the other player wins.

Given an integer array piles, where piles[i] is the number of stones in the ith pile, return true if Alice wins, or false if Bob wins.

Both Alice and Bob play optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: piles = [1]
Output: true
Explanation: There is only one possible scenario:
- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0].
- On the second turn, there are no stones left for Bob to remove. Alice wins.


Example 2:


Input: piles = [1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:
- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1].
- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0].
- On the third turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.


Example 3:


Input: piles = [1,2,3]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:
- On the first turn, Alice removes three stones from the third pile. piles = [1,2,0].
- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [1,1,0].
- On the third turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1,0].
- On the fourth turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0,0].
- On the fifth turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.

 

Constraints:

 * n == piles.length
 * 1 <= n <= 7
 * 1 <= piles[i] <= 7

 

Follow-up: Could you find a linear time solution? Although the linear time solution may be beyond the scope of an interview, it could be interesting to know.
