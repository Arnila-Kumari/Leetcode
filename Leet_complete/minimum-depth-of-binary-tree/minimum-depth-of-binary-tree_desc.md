Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Depth of Binary Tree - Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
