Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Largest Palindrome Divisible by K - You are given two positive integers n and k.

An integer x is called k-palindromic if:

 * x is a palindrome.
 * x is divisible by k.

Return the largest integer having n digits (as a string) that is k-palindromic.

Note that the integer must not have leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 5

Output: "595"

Explanation:

595 is the largest k-palindromic integer with 3 digits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 4

Output: "8"

Explanation:

4 and 8 are the only k-palindromic integers with 1 digit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, k = 6

Output: "89898"

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= n <= 105
 * 1 <= k <= 9
