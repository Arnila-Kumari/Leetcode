Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced - You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

 * It is the empty string, or
 * It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
 * It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.

You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".


Example 2:


Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".


Example 3:


Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.


 

Constraints:

 * n == s.length
 * 2 <= n <= 106
 * n is even.
 * s[i] is either '[' or ']'.
 * The number of opening brackets '[' equals n / 2, and the number of closing brackets ']' equals n / 2.
