Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Prime Difference - You are given an integer array nums.

Return an integer that is the maximum distance between the indices of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,9,5,3]

Output: 3

Explanation: nums[1], nums[3], and nums[4] are prime. So the answer is |4 - 1| = 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,8,2,8]

Output: 0

Explanation: nums[2] is prime. Because there is just one prime number, the answer is |2 - 2| = 0.

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 105
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
 * The input is generated such that the number of prime numbers in the nums is at least one.
