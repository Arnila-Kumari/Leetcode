Can you solve this real interview question? Longest Common Prefix After at Most One Removal - You are given two strings s and t.

Return the length of the longest common prefix between s and t after removing at most one character from s.

Note: s can be left without any removal.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "madxa", t = "madam"

Output: 4

Explanation:

Removing s[3] from s results in "mada", which has a longest common prefix of length 4 with t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "eetcode"

Output: 7

Explanation:
