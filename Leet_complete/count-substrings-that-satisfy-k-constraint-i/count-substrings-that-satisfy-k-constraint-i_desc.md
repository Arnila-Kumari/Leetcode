Can you solve this real interview question? Count Substrings That Satisfy K-Constraint I - You are given a binary string s and an integer k.

A binary string satisfies the k-constraint if either of the following conditions holds:

 * The number of 0's in the string is at most k.
 * The number of 1's in the string is at most k.

Return an integer denoting the number of substrings of s that satisfy the k-constraint.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "10101", k = 1

Output: 12

Explanation:

Every substring of s except the substrings "1010", "10101", and "0101" satisfies the k-constraint.

Example 2:

Input: s = "1010101", k = 2

Output: 25

Explanation:

Every substring of s except the substrings with a length greater than 5 satisfies the k-constraint.

Example 3:

Input: s = "11111", k = 1

Output: 15

Explanation:

All substrings of s satisfy the k-constraint.

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= s.length <= 50
 * 1 <= k <= s.length
 * s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
