Can you solve this real interview question? Linked List Components - You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the linked list is n.
 * 1 <= n <= 104
 * 0 <= Node.val < n
 * All the values Node.val are unique.
 * 1 <= nums.length <= n
 * 0 <= nums[i] < n
 * All the values of nums are unique.
