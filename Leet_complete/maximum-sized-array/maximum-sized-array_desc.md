Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Sized Array - Given a positive integer s, let A be a 3D array of dimensions n × n × n, where each element A[i][j][k] is defined as:

 * A[i][j][k] = i * (j OR k), where 0 <= i, j, k < n.

Return the maximum possible value of n such that the sum of all elements in array A does not exceed s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = 10

Output: 2

Explanation:

 * Elements of the array A for n = 2:
   * A[0][0][0] = 0 * (0 OR 0) = 0
   * A[0][0][1] = 0 * (0 OR 1) = 0
   * A[0][1][0] = 0 * (1 OR 0) = 0
   * A[0][1][1] = 0 * (1 OR 1) = 0
   * A[1][0][0] = 1 * (0 OR 0) = 0
   * A[1][0][1] = 1 * (0 OR 1) = 1
   * A[1][1][0] = 1 * (1 OR 0) = 1
   * A[1][1][1] = 1 * (1 OR 1) = 1
 * The total sum of the elements in array A is 3, which does not exceed 10, so the maximum possible value of n is 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = 0

Output: 1

Explanation:

 * Elements of the array A for n = 1:
   * A[0][0][0] = 0 * (0 OR 0) = 0
 * The total sum of the elements in array A is 0, which does not exceed 0, so the maximum possible value of n is 1.

 

Constraints:

 * 0 <= s <= 1015
