Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together - Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1’s present in the array together in any place in the array.

 

Example 1:


Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.


Example 2:


Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps are needed.


Example 3:


Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= data.length <= 105
 * data[i] is either 0 or 1.
