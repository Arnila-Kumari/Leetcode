Can you solve this real interview question? Count Number of Nice Subarrays - Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A continuous subarray is called nice if there are k odd numbers on it.

Return the number of nice sub-arrays.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].


Example 2:


Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in the array.


Example 3:


Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 16


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 50000
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 * 1 <= k <= nums.length
