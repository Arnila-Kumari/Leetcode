Can you solve this real interview question? Binary Tree Level Order Traversal - Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]


Example 2:


Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]


Example 3:


Input: root = []
Output: []


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
