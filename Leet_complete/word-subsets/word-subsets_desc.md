Can you solve this real interview question? Word Subsets - You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

 * For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".

A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]

Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]

Example 2:

Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["lc","eo"]

Output: ["leetcode"]

Example 3:

Input: words1 = ["acaac","cccbb","aacbb","caacc","bcbbb"], words2 = ["c","cc","b"]

Output: ["cccbb"]

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104
 * 1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
 * words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.
 * All the strings of words1 are unique.
