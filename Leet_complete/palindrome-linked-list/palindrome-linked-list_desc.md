Can you solve this real interview question? Palindrome Linked List - Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 9

 

Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
