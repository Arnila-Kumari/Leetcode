Can you solve this real interview question? Univalued Binary Tree - A binary tree is uni-valued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the given tree is uni-valued, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: root = [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: root = [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
 * 0 <= Node.val < 100
