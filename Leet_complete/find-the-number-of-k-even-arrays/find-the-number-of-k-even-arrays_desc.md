Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Number of K-Even Arrays - You are given three integers n, m, and k.

An array arr is called k-even if there are exactly k indices such that, for each of these indices i (0 <= i < n - 1):

 * (arr[i] * arr[i + 1]) - arr[i] - arr[i + 1] is even.

Return the number of possible k-even arrays of size n where all elements are in the range [1, m].

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, m = 4, k = 2

Output: 8

Explanation:

The 8 possible 2-even arrays are:

 * [2, 2, 2]
 * [2, 2, 4]
 * [2, 4, 2]
 * [2, 4, 4]
 * [4, 2, 2]
 * [4, 2, 4]
 * [4, 4, 2]
 * [4, 4, 4]

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, m = 1, k = 0

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only 0-even array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Example 3:

Input: n = 7, m = 7, k = 5

Output: 5832

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= n <= 750
 * 0 <= k <= n - 1
 * 1 <= m <= 1000
