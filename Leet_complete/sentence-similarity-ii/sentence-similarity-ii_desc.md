Can you solve this real interview question? Sentence Similarity II - We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence "I am happy with leetcode" can be represented as arr = ["I","am",happy","with","leetcode"].

Given two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs similarPairs where similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi] indicates that the two words xi and yi are similar.

Return true if sentence1 and sentence2 are similar, or false if they are not similar.

Two sentences are similar if:

 * They have the same length (i.e., the same number of words)
 * sentence1[i] and sentence2[i] are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if the words a and b are similar, and the words b and c are similar, then a and c are similar.

 

Example 1:


Input: sentence1 = ["great","acting","skills"], sentence2 = ["fine","drama","talent"], similarPairs = [["great","good"],["fine","good"],["drama","acting"],["skills","talent"]]
Output: true
Explanation: The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.


Example 2:


Input: sentence1 = ["I","love","leetcode"], sentence2 = ["I","love","onepiece"], similarPairs = [["manga","onepiece"],["platform","anime"],["leetcode","platform"],["anime","manga"]]
Output: true
Explanation: "leetcode" --> "platform" --> "anime" --> "manga" --> "onepiece".
Since "leetcode is similar to "onepiece" and the first two words are the same, the two sentences are similar.

Example 3:


Input: sentence1 = ["I","love","leetcode"], sentence2 = ["I","love","onepiece"], similarPairs = [["manga","hunterXhunter"],["platform","anime"],["leetcode","platform"],["anime","manga"]]
Output: false
Explanation: "leetcode" is not similar to "onepiece".


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= sentence1[i].length, sentence2[i].length <= 20
 * sentence1[i] and sentence2[i] consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.
 * 0 <= similarPairs.length <= 2000
 * similarPairs[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= xi.length, yi.length <= 20
 * xi and yi consist of English letters.
