Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks - You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.

Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.

 

Example 1:


Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.


Example 2:


Input: tasks = [2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= tasks.length <= 105
 * 1 <= tasks[i] <= 109
