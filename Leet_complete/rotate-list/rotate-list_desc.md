Can you solve this real interview question? Rotate List - Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]


Example 2:

![Example 2](./image_2.png)


Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 * 0 <= k <= 2 * 109
