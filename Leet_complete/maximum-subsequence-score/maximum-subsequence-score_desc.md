Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Subsequence Score - You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.

For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

 * The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
 * It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).

Return the maximum possible score.

A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.
Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Choosing index 2 is optimal: nums1[2] * nums2[2] = 3 * 10 = 30 is the maximum possible score.


 

Constraints:

 * n == nums1.length == nums2.length
 * 1 <= n <= 105
 * 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 105
 * 1 <= k <= n
