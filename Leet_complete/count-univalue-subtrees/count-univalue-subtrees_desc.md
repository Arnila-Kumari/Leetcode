Can you solve this real interview question? Count Univalue Subtrees - Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of uni-value subtrees.

A uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

 

Example 1:

![Example 1](./image_1.png)


Input: root = [5,1,5,5,5,null,5]
Output: 4


Example 2:


Input: root = []
Output: 0


Example 3:


Input: root = [5,5,5,5,5,null,5]
Output: 6


 

Constraints:

 * The number of the node in the tree will be in the range [0, 1000].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
