Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Hamming Distances - Given an array nums and an integer m, with each element nums[i] satisfying 0 <= nums[i] < 2m, return an array answer. The answer array should be of the same length as nums, where each element answer[i] represents the maximum Hamming distance between nums[i] and any other element nums[j] in the array.

The Hamming distance between two binary integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits differ (add leading zeroes if needed).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [9,12,9,11], m = 4

Output: [2,3,2,3]

Explanation:

The binary representation of nums = [1001,1100,1001,1011].

The maximum hamming distances for each index are:

 * nums[0]: 1001 and 1100 have a distance of 2.
 * nums[1]: 1100 and 1011 have a distance of 3.
 * nums[2]: 1001 and 1100 have a distance of 2.
 * nums[3]: 1011 and 1100 have a distance of 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,6,10], m = 4

Output: [3,3,2,3]

Explanation:

The binary representation of nums = [0011,0100,0110,1010].

The maximum hamming distances for each index are:

 * nums[0]: 0011 and 0100 have a distance of 3.
 * nums[1]: 0100 and 0011 have a distance of 3.
 * nums[2]: 0110 and 1010 have a distance of 2.
 * nums[3]: 1010 and 0100 have a distance of 3.

 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= m <= 17
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 2m
 * 0 <= nums[i] < 2m
