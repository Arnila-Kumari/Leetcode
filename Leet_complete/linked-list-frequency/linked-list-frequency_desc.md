Can you solve this real interview question? Linked List Frequency - Given the head of a linked list containing k distinct elements, return the head to a linked list of length k containing the frequency of each distinct element in the given linked list in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,1,2,1,2,3]

Output: [3,2,1]

Explanation: There are 3 distinct elements in the list. The frequency of 1 is 3, the frequency of 2 is 2 and the frequency of 3 is 1. Hence, we return 3 -> 2 -> 1.

Note that 1 -> 2 -> 3, 1 -> 3 -> 2, 2 -> 1 -> 3, 2 -> 3 -> 1, and 3 -> 1 -> 2 are also valid answers.

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,2,2,2]

Output: [2,3]

Explanation: There are 2 distinct elements in the list. The frequency of 1 is 2 and the frequency of 2 is 3. Hence, we return 2 -> 3.

Example 3:

Input: head = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

Output: [1,1,1,1,1,1]

Explanation: There are 6 distinct elements in the list. The frequency of each of them is 1. Hence, we return 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1.

 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 105
