Can you solve this real interview question? Find a Safe Walk Through a Grid - You are given an m x n binary matrix grid and an integer health.

You start on the upper-left corner (0, 0) and would like to get to the lower-right corner (m - 1, n - 1).

You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another adjacent cell as long as your health remains positive.

Cells (i, j) with grid[i][j] = 1 are considered unsafe and reduce your health by 1.

Return true if you can reach the final cell with a health value of 1 or more, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]], health = 1

Output: true

Explanation:

The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,1],[0,0,1,0,1,0]], health = 3

Output: false

Explanation:

A minimum of 4 health points is needed to reach the final cell safely.

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]], health = 5

Output: true

Explanation:

The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.

![Example 3](./image_3.png)

Any path that does not go through the cell (1, 1) is unsafe since your health will drop to 0 when reaching the final cell.

 

Constraints:

 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * 2 <= m * n
 * 1 <= health <= m + n
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
