    [
      "The core idea is to maintain a list `LIS` where `LIS[i]` is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1`.",
      "Binary search is used to efficiently find the correct position to insert or replace an element in `LIS`.",
      "The length of `LIS` at the end is the length of the longest increasing subsequence."
    ],
    [
      "This solution manually implements binary search to find the insertion point, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the algorithm.",
      "The logic is identical to the `bisect` version but shows the underlying search mechanism.",
      "Efficiency comes from not re-scanning previous elements for each new number."
    ],
    [
      "Coordinate compression maps original values to smaller indices, suitable for BIT/Segment Tree.",
      "BIT/Segment Tree is used to query the maximum LIS length ending before the current element's compressed index.",
      "The update operation in BIT/Segment Tree reflects the LIS length ending at the current element."
    ],
    [
      "Similar to BIT, Segment Tree is used for range maximum queries after coordinate compression.",
      "The Segment Tree efficiently finds the maximum LIS length ending at values less than the current number.",
      "This approach is more general for range queries but might have a slightly larger constant factor than BIT."
    ],
    [
      "This is the standard DP approach where `dp[i]` stores the length of the LIS ending at `nums[i]`.",
      "It iterates through all previous elements `j < i` to find the maximum `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[j] < nums[i]`.",
      "The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops."
