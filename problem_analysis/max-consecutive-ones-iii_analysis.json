      "This is a classic sliding window problem where we maintain a window of valid 1s (allowing k flips).",
      "The window expands by moving the right pointer (`j`). If the number of zeros in the window exceeds `k`, the window shrinks by moving the left pointer (`i`)."

      "The condition `K < 0` signifies that we have used more flips than allowed.",
      "The `while K < 0` loop ensures that the window is valid by removing elements from the left until `K` is non-negative again."

      "The length of the valid window is `j - i + 1`.",
