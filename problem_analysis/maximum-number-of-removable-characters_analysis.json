      "The `check` function's efficiency is crucial; using a set for O(1) average lookup is better than linear scan."

      "Pre-calculating the removal index to its order in `removable` allows for O(1) check for whether an index is removed.",
      "This pre-calculation optimizes the `check` function's performance.",
      "The core logic remains binary search on the number of removals."
