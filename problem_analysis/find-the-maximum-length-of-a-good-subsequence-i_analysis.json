      "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where the state tracks the current length and the number of changes made.",
      "Mapping unique numbers to indices can optimize space if the number of unique elements is much smaller than n.",
      "The transition involves considering extending a subsequence with the same number or a different number (if k allows)."
    ],
    [
      "Using `defaultdict` simplifies the DP state management, especially when dealing with potentially sparse values.",
      "The `result` array acts as a global maximum for a given number of changes, allowing efficient updates for the next state.",
      "Iterating `i` in reverse ensures that `result[i-1]` uses values from the previous iteration, preventing double-counting."
    ],
    [
      "This approach uses a more direct DP state `dp[i][l]` representing the max length of a good subsequence ending at index `i` with `l` changes.",
      "The transitions involve checking all previous indices `j` to extend the subsequence.",
      "This O(n^2 * k) approach is less efficient than the O(n*k) solutions but conceptually simpler for some."
