      "Iterating from `num // 2` to `num` is a reasonable brute-force range because if `x + reverse(x) = num`, then `x` cannot be much larger than `num / 2`.",

      "This approach is conceptually simple but might be slightly less efficient than integer arithmetic for reversal due to string overhead."
