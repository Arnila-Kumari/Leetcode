      "The problem can be transformed into finding the maximum independent set on a graph where nodes are valid seats and edges represent conflicts.",
      "By coloring the seats like a chessboard, the problem becomes a bipartite graph matching problem.",
      "The number of students is the total valid seats minus the size of the maximum matching (which equals the minimum vertex cover). Hopcroft-Karp finds this efficiently."
    ],
    [
      "Similar to Hopcroft-Karp, this uses bipartite matching but with a simpler DFS-based approach for finding augmenting paths.",
      "The graph construction and the concept of maximum independent set remain the same.",
      "The time complexity is generally higher than Hopcroft-Karp for dense graphs."

    [
      "Dynamic programming can be used row by row, where the state represents the valid student placements in the current row.",
      "Bitmasking is crucial to represent the configuration of students in a row and check for cheating conflicts with adjacent seats and previous row's students.",
      "The transitions involve iterating through all valid placements in the current row based on the previous row's state."
