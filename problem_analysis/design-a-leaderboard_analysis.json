    [
      "A hash map (like `collections.Counter`) is perfect for O(1) average time complexity for `addScore` and `reset` operations.",
      "The `top(K)` operation is the bottleneck. Sorting all scores takes O(n log n).",
      "A more efficient approach for `top(K)` is to use a selection algorithm like Quickselect to find the Kth largest element in O(n) average time."
    ],
    [
      "The `kthElement` function implements a randomized Quickselect algorithm to find the Kth smallest element (or in this case, the Kth largest by comparing in reverse).",
      "By partitioning the scores array around a pivot, we can narrow down the search space for the Kth element.",
      "After finding the Kth largest element, the first K elements in the (partially sorted) array will be the top K scores, allowing for their summation."
