    [
      "The problem is a classic application of binary search due to the ordered nature of the search space and the feedback provided.",
      "The `guess` API's return values (-1, 1, 0) directly map to adjusting the search range in binary search.",
      "Careful handling of `left` and `right` pointers is crucial to avoid infinite loops and ensure correctness."
