    [
      "Solution 1 (Difference Array): Efficient for fixed, small ranges. Marks start/end of intervals to calculate coverage.",
      "Solution 2 (Sorting): Good for larger ranges where sorting is amortized. Greedy approach works by extending coverage.",
      "Solution 3 (Brute Force): Simple to understand but less efficient for large ranges or many intervals."
    ],
    [
      "The constraints on `left`, `right`, and `endi` (<= 50) make the difference array approach very viable.",
      "The greedy approach for Solution 2 relies on the fact that we only care about covering the `left` boundary and extending it."

      "The problem can be rephrased as finding if the union of intervals covers the target range.",
