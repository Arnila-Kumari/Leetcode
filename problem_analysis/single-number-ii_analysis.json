      "Bit manipulation is crucial for achieving O(1) space complexity.",
      "The core idea is to track bits that appear once and twice to identify the number appearing once.",

    [
      "The bit manipulation approach with 'one' and 'two' variables cleverly simulates a 3-bit counter.",
      "When a bit appears for the third time, it resets in both 'one' and 'two'.",
      "This avoids explicit counting and maintains constant space."

    [
      "Using `collections.Counter` is a straightforward way to solve this if space is not a constraint.",
      "The logic `(set(nums) * 3) - nums` effectively isolates the unique element.",
      "This approach is less efficient in terms of space and potentially time for very large inputs."
    ],
    [
      "The mathematical approach relies on the property that `3 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)` will isolate the unique number.",
      "This works because each number appearing thrice contributes 3 times to both sums, while the unique number contributes once.",
      "The division by 2 is a consequence of how the unique number is isolated."
