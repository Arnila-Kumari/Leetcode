      "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining states that represent the maximum profit after a certain number of transactions (buy or sell).",
      "The states can be: `hold1` (max profit after buying the first stock), `release1` (max profit after selling the first stock), `hold2` (max profit after buying the second stock), `release2` (max profit after selling the second stock).",
      "The transitions involve considering the current price and the previous states."

    [
      "The problem can be generalized to at most `k` transactions. The DP approach for `k` transactions can be applied with `k=2`.",
      "The DP state `max_buy[j]` would represent the maximum profit after buying the `j`-th stock, and `max_sell[j]` would represent the maximum profit after selling the `j`-th stock.",
      "This approach is more general and can be adapted for any number of transactions."

      "A two-pass approach can also solve this. First, calculate the maximum profit achievable with one transaction ending on each day (from left to right).",
      "Second, calculate the maximum profit achievable with one transaction starting on each day (from right to left).",
      "The final answer is the maximum sum of profits from the left pass and the right pass for each split point."
