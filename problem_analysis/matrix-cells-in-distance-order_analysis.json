      "The problem requires sorting cells based on Manhattan distance (|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|).",
      "A naive approach would be to calculate the distance for all cells and then sort them.",
      "An optimized approach generates cells in increasing order of distance, avoiding a full sort.",
      "The spiral-like generation pattern ensures cells are visited in distance order."

      "The provided solution cleverly generates cells by expanding outwards in 'diamond' shapes.",
      "It starts with the center cell (distance 0) and then iterates through increasing distances `d`.",
      "For each distance `d`, it checks cells at `(r0-d, c0)`, `(r0+d, c0)`, and points along the diagonals `(r0+x, c0 +/- (d - |x|))`.",
      "Boundary checks (`0 <= r < R` and `0 <= c < C`) are essential to only include valid cells."
