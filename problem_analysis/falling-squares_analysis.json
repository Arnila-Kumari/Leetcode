    [
      "The problem requires efficiently querying the maximum height of existing squares in the horizontal range where a new square will land.",
      "Coordinate compression is useful to map potentially large coordinates to a smaller, contiguous range for data structures like segment trees.",
      "A segment tree is ideal for range maximum queries and point/range updates."
    ],
    [
      "The provided SegmentTree and SegmentTree2 classes implement range maximum queries and range updates.",
      "The `fallingSquares` method in `Solution2` uses coordinate compression to map the square intervals to indices in the segment tree.",
      "The `max` function is used as the query and update function for the segment tree to find the maximum height."
    ],
    [
      "The square root decomposition approach (Solution3) divides the coordinate space into blocks to optimize queries and updates.",
      "It balances the overhead of block processing with the efficiency of direct array access.",
      "This can be an alternative when segment trees might be too complex or have higher constant factors."
    ],
    [
      "The brute-force approach (Solution4) iterates through all previously fallen squares to determine the landing height of the current square.",
      "This leads to an O(n^2) time complexity due to nested loops.",
      "It's simpler to implement but less efficient for larger inputs."
