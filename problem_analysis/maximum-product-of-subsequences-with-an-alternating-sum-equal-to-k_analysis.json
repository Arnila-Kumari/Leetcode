      "This problem requires finding a subsequence that satisfies two conditions: alternating sum and maximum product within a limit.",
      "Dynamic programming is a suitable approach. The state needs to capture the alternating sum and potentially the parity of the last element added.",
      "The product needs to be managed carefully, possibly by storing sets of achievable products for each state and capping them at `limit + 1` to avoid overflow and prune."
