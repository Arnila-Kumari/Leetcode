      "A common and robust approach for linked list modifications, especially removals from the head, is to use a dummy node.",
      "The dummy node simplifies edge cases, such as removing the actual head of the list.",
      "We maintain two pointers: `prev` (pointing to the node before `curr`) and `curr` (the node being examined)."
    ],
    [
      "When `curr.val == val`, we bypass `curr` by setting `prev.next = curr.next`.",
      "If `curr.val != val`, we advance `prev` to `curr` because `curr` is a node we want to keep.",
      "The loop continues until `curr` reaches the end of the list, and `dummy.next` will point to the new head."
