      "The greedy strategy works because covering an 'X' with a move of length 3 is always optimal.",
      "By moving 3 steps forward after encountering an 'X', we ensure that the current 'X' is covered and we don't re-process characters unnecessarily.",
      "This approach guarantees that each 'X' is covered by at least one move, and we minimize the number of moves."
