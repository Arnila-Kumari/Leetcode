      "The score can be efficiently updated as we move the split point. Instead of recounting, we can increment the zero count and decrement the one count (or vice-versa) for the left/right substrings.",
      "The problem can be optimized by observing that the score is `(zeros_left) + (total_ones - ones_left)`. This can be rewritten as `zeros_left - ones_left + total_ones`. Maximizing this is equivalent to maximizing `zeros_left - ones_left`."
