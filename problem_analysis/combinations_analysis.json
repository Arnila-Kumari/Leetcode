      "The iterative solutions cleverly manipulate indices to generate combinations in lexicographical order.",
      "The `while True` loop with `break` conditions manages the generation process.",
      "The `else` clause in the `for` loop handles the case where all combinations have been generated."
    ],
    [
      "The second iterative solution uses `combination.pop()` and `i = combination.pop()+1` to backtrack and explore new branches.",
      "The condition `len(combination)+(n-i+1) < k` is a pruning step to avoid unnecessary exploration."
    ],
    [
      "The recursive backtracking solution is intuitive for combination problems.",
      "The `start` parameter ensures that numbers are chosen in increasing order, preventing duplicate combinations.",
      "The base case `k == 0` signifies a complete combination."
