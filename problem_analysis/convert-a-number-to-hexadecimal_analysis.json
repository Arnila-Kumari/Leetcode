      "Hexadecimal conversion involves grouping bits into nibbles (4 bits). Each nibble corresponds to a hex digit (0-9, a-f).",
      "The bitwise AND operation `num & 15` isolates the last 4 bits, which represent the current hex digit.",
      "The right shift `num >>= 4` moves the next 4 bits to the least significant position for the next iteration.",
      "For negative numbers, the two's complement representation is handled naturally by the bitwise operations in Python, effectively processing all 32 bits."
