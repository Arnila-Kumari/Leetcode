      "The standard two-BFS approach is a common and efficient way to find the diameter of a tree.",
      "The first BFS finds an endpoint of a diameter, and the second BFS from that endpoint finds the other endpoint and the diameter length.",
      "The `ceil_divide` function is used to find the radius of each tree, which is crucial for calculating the merged diameter."
