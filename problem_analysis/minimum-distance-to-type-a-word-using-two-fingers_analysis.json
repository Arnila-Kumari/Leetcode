      "The first solution uses a clever DP state compression by realizing only the previous character matters for the total distance calculation."

    [
      "The second solution uses a more explicit DP state where `dp[(char1, char2)]` stores the minimum cost to type up to the current character with fingers on `char1` and `char2`.",
      "The base case is `dp[(-1, -1)] = 0`, representing initial free finger positions.",
      "Transitions involve considering placing the current character with either finger, updating the DP table accordingly."
