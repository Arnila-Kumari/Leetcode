    [
      "This solution also uses divide and conquer but with a different strategy for processing the 'stripe' of points.",
      "It focuses on maintaining sorted lists of points within the strip based on the y-coordinate.",
      "The core idea is that for any point, potential closest points in the strip are limited in number."

    [
      "Segment trees can be used to efficiently query for points that satisfy certain coordinate conditions.",
      "By transforming the Manhattan distance into sums and differences of coordinates, we can use segment trees to find maximums/minimums in ranges.",
      "This approach avoids explicit sorting of the strip in the divide and conquer method, offering an alternative O(n log n) solution."
