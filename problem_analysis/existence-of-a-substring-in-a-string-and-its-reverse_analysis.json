      "The core idea is to efficiently check for the presence of substrings.",
      "A hash table (like a 2D array for character pairs or a defaultdict of sets) is suitable for O(1) average time lookups.",
      "The problem can be solved by either: 1. Storing all substrings of `s` and checking against `s[::-1]`, or 2. Storing all substrings of `s` and checking against `s` itself (since if `sub` is in `s` and `sub` is in `s[::-1]`, then `sub` must be a palindrome of length 2, or `sub` and its reverse are present in `s`). The provided solution uses the latter approach implicitly by checking `s[i]` in `lookup[s[i+1]]` which is equivalent to checking if `s[i]s[i+1]` is present in the reverse.",
      "The space complexity is bounded by the number of possible 2-character substrings (26*26) or the length of the string, whichever is smaller."
