      "Python's built-in `hex()` function simplifies the initial conversion.",
      "String methods like `.upper()`, `.replace()`, and `.all()` are powerful for manipulation and validation.",
      "The constraint on the input number size (up to 10^12) means the hexadecimal representation won't be excessively long."
