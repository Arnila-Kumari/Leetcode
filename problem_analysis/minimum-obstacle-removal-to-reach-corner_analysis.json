      "Empty cells (0) are added to the front of the deque (cost 0), and obstacles (1) are added to the back (cost 1).",
      "This ensures that cells reachable with fewer obstacle removals are explored first."

      "The problem can be viewed as finding a path that minimizes the sum of obstacle values (1s) along the path.",
