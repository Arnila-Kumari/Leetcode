    [
      "A stack is a natural fit for this problem because it allows easy access to the most recent asteroid that could collide.",
      "The core logic involves handling the interaction between a new incoming asteroid (especially a negative one) and the top of the stack.",
      "Careful handling of equal-sized asteroids and the case where a negative asteroid destroys all positive asteroids on the stack is crucial."
    ],
    [
      "The `else` block in the `while` loop is key for appending the asteroid only if no collision occurred or if the collision resulted in the new asteroid's survival.",
      "The `break` statement is used to exit the `while` loop once a collision is resolved or the new asteroid is determined to be added.",
      "This solution is slightly more concise by using the `else` clause of the `while` loop to handle appending."
