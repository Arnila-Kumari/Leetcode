      "If a solution exists, the target value for the uniform row must be present in either the top or bottom half of every domino.",
      "This means the target value must be in the intersection of the set of values in `tops` and the set of values in `bottoms`.",
      "Once a candidate target value `x` is found, the minimum rotations to make the top row `x` is `N - count(x in tops)`, and to make the bottom row `x` is `N - count(x in bottoms)`. The overall minimum is the minimum of these for all candidate `x`."

      "The provided solution efficiently finds the candidate value by taking the intersection of sets of values from `tops` and `bottoms`.",
      "If the intersection is empty, no such uniform row can be formed, and -1 is returned.",
      "If the intersection is not empty, any element `x` from the intersection is a potential target. The minimum rotations to make the top row `x` is `len(A) - A.count(x)`, and to make the bottom row `x` is `len(B) - B.count(x)`. The minimum of these two is the answer for that `x`. Since there can be at most one common value that can form a uniform row, we just need to check that one."
