      "A Trie is a natural fit for storing and comparing subarrays lexicographically.",

      "Rolling hash can represent subarrays as integers, allowing for faster comparison.",
      "Careful handling of hash collisions is necessary, often by using multiple hash functions or a secondary check.",
      "The `check` function in Solution2 is to ensure that if hashes collide, the actual subarrays are different."
    ],
    [
      "Using a set with rolling hashes simplifies distinctness checking, assuming minimal hash collisions.",
      "The base for the rolling hash should be chosen carefully (e.g., larger than max element value).",
      "The modulo operation is essential to keep hash values within bounds."
