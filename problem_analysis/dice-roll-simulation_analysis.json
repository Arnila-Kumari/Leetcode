      "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where the state depends on the previous roll and the number of consecutive rolls.",
      "The DP state can be optimized by only keeping track of the counts for the previous roll.",
      "The modulo operation is crucial to prevent integer overflow."
    ],
    [
      "The DP state can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to roll i dice such that the last roll was a specific number and it was the j-th consecutive occurrence of that number.",
      "Transitions involve considering all possible previous rolls and their consecutive counts.",
      "The base case is for n=1, where each face has 1 way."
