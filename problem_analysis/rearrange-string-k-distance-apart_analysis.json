      "The greedy strategy with a max-heap is effective because placing the most frequent characters first helps satisfy the k-distance constraint.",
      "When a character is used, it's temporarily put aside (in a 'wait' list or similar) until k positions have passed.",
      "The condition `k <= 1` is a base case where no rearrangement is needed."

    [
      "This approach attempts to distribute characters evenly across 'buckets' defined by the k-distance.",
      "It checks feasibility by ensuring no bucket has too many characters or that the most frequent character doesn't exceed a calculated limit.",
      "The sorting of characters based on their counts is key to this distribution strategy."
