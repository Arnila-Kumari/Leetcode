      "The key insight is that if you can reach position `i-1` with a certain minimum cost, you can also reach position `i` with at most that same cost.",
      "This is because you can always choose to swap with person `i-1` (if `cost[i-1]` is cheaper than `cost[i]`) and then effectively be at position `i-1`, from which you can reach `i` for free (or with the same cost as reaching `i-1`).",
      "The problem can be solved by iterating from left to right and maintaining the minimum cost seen so far."
