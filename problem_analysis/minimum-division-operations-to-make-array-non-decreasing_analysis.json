      "The core idea is that to reduce a number `x` as much as possible with one operation, we should divide it by its greatest proper divisor.",
      "The greatest proper divisor of a number `x` is `x / smallest_prime_factor(x)`.",
      "A greedy approach works by processing the array from right to left. If `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`, we must reduce `nums[i]`. The optimal way to reduce `nums[i]` to satisfy the condition with minimal operations is to divide it by its smallest prime factor until it's less than or equal to `nums[i+1]`."

      "Pre-computing the smallest prime factor (SPF) for all numbers up to the maximum possible value in `nums` is crucial for efficient calculation.",
      "The condition `SPF[nums[i]] > nums[i+1]` implies that even after dividing `nums[i]` by its smallest prime factor, it will still be greater than `nums[i+1]`, making it impossible to satisfy the non-decreasing property.",
      "The problem statement guarantees that if a solution exists, the greedy approach will find it because each operation aims to make the number as small as possible with a single step."
