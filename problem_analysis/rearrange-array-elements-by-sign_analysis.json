    [
      "The problem guarantees an equal number of positive and negative integers and an even length array.",
      "The relative order of positive numbers among themselves and negative numbers among themselves must be maintained.",
      "A two-pointer approach can efficiently place elements into a new result array at alternating indices (0, 2, 4... for positives; 1, 3, 5... for negatives)."
    ],
    [
      "Separating positive and negative numbers into two lists first simplifies the merging process.",
      "Popping from the end of these lists (if populated in reverse) or iterating through them directly allows for maintaining relative order.",
      "This approach is conceptually clear but uses extra space for the temporary lists."
    ],
    [
      "Generators provide an elegant way to iterate through positive and negative numbers without explicitly creating separate lists.",
      "This approach is memory-efficient as it yields numbers on demand.",
      "The main loop then picks from the appropriate generator based on the index parity."
