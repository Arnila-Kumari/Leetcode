      "The problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in a state space where states are numbers formed by the digits.",
      "BFS is suitable because it explores numbers in increasing order of magnitude, guaranteeing the first valid number found is the smallest.",
      "The state space is limited by the maximum number of digits (10) and the two allowed digits, making BFS efficient.",
      "Edge cases like identical digits or leading zeros need careful handling."
