      "The problem can be broken down into two main checks: 1. Can a stamp fit entirely within the grid and not cover any occupied cells? 2. Can every empty cell be covered by at least one such valid stamp?",
      "2D prefix sums are crucial for efficiently querying the number of occupied cells within any rectangular subgrid (potential stamp area).",
      "A second 2D prefix sum can track where valid stamps can be placed, allowing for efficient checking if all empty cells are covered."
