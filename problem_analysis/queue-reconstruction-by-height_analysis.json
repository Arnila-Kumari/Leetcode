      "The key insight is that if we sort people by height in descending order, the k value for a person only depends on people already placed (who are taller or equal height).",

      "This solution uses a block-based approach to optimize insertions. Instead of a single list, it uses multiple blocks.",
      "When a block gets too large, it's split, aiming to keep insertion times closer to O(sqrt(n)) on average.",
      "The sorting step remains crucial for the greedy strategy to work."
