      "The problem can be rephrased as finding land cells that are not connected to any land cell on the boundary.",
      "A common approach is to start a traversal (like DFS or BFS) from all land cells on the boundary.",
      "Any land cell visited during these boundary traversals is considered 'reachable' from the boundary. The remaining land cells are the enclaves."

    [
      "The provided DFS solution modifies the input grid in-place by changing visited land cells to 0.",
      "This avoids the need for a separate `visited` set, reducing space complexity if in-place modification is allowed.",
      "The time complexity is O(m*n) because each cell is visited at most a constant number of times."
