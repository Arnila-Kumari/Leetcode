      "Sorted lists provide efficient insertion, deletion, and access to the k smallest elements.",
      "The sliding window approach iterates through possible end points of the last subarray.",

    [
      "This solution optimizes by directly calculating the sum of the k smallest elements in the window.",
      "Updates to the sum are done efficiently by considering the element entering and leaving the window.",
      "The `SortedList` handles maintaining the order and allows quick retrieval of the k-th smallest element."
