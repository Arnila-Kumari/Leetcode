      "The core idea is that a square of side `k` ending at `(i, j)` can only exist if there are squares of side `k-1` ending at `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`.",
      "The value at `matrix[i][j]` is updated to be `min(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1], matrix[i-1][j-1]) + 1` if `matrix[i][j]` is 1, effectively storing the size of the largest square ending at that cell.",
      "The total count is the sum of all values in the modified matrix, as each value `k` at `(i, j)` represents `k` squares of different sizes ending at that cell."
