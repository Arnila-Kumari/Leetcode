      "The problem can be modeled as a DP where `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum score considering columns up to `j`, with the `j`-th column having `i` black cells (from top to bottom).",
      "Prefix sums are crucial for efficiently calculating the sum of values in a column segment, which is needed when transitioning DP states."
    ],
    [
      "The state transition involves considering all possible previous states (number of black cells in the previous column) and the current operation (coloring the current column up to row `i`).",
      "The score calculation involves summing values of white cells that gain a black neighbor. This requires careful consideration of the boundary between black and white cells in the current column and the coloring in the previous column."
