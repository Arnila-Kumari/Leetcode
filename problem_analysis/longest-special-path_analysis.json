      "A 'special path' implies no repeated node values. This can be tracked using a hashmap (or set) during traversal.",

    [
      "The DFS explores downward paths, maintaining the set of visited node values and the current path length.",
      "When a node value is encountered that has already been seen in the current path, the path is no longer 'special' from that point onwards.",
      "The `lookup` map stores the depth at which a node value was last seen, enabling efficient calculation of the longest valid path segment ending at the current node."
