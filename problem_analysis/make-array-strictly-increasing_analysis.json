      "This is a classic DP problem where the state needs to capture the minimum cost to achieve a certain prefix.",

      "When processing `arr1[i]`, we consider two options: either keep `arr1[i]` if it's greater than the previous `end_val`, or replace it with an element from `arr2` using binary search to find the smallest valid replacement."
