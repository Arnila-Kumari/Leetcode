      "The price of a number depends on set bits at positions x, 2x, 3x, etc. This suggests a pattern related to powers of 2 and x.",

      "The problem can be reframed as finding the largest number `num` such that the sum of prices of numbers from 1 to `num` is at most `k`.",
      "The price calculation involves checking bits at indices `i` where `(i+1)` is a multiple of `x`. This can be efficiently calculated using bit manipulation and properties of powers of 2.",
      "The iterative approach builds the number bit by bit, greedily choosing the largest possible bit at each step while ensuring the accumulated price constraint is met."
