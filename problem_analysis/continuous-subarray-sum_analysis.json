      "The core idea is that if the prefix sum up to index i and the prefix sum up to index j (where i < j) have the same remainder when divided by k, then the sum of the subarray between i+1 and j is a multiple of k.",
      "A hashmap stores the first occurrence of each remainder to efficiently check for previous occurrences.",
      "The condition `i - lookup[count] > 1` ensures the subarray length is at least two."
