      "The problem requires finding the lexicographically largest substring after partitioning. This suggests a greedy approach.",
      "The core idea is to find the starting point of the substring that, when combined with the remaining characters (after accounting for `numFriends - 1` other splits), yields the largest string.",
      "The logic `word[i-l] >= word[i]` helps decide if extending the current potential substring is better than starting a new one at `i`."
