      "Each shift operation `[start, end, direction]` can be represented as an event at `start` and `end+1`.",
      "A forward shift (`direction=1`) increases the shift count, while a backward shift (`direction=0`) decreases it.",
      "A difference array (or event array) can efficiently track the net change in shift at each position.",
      "Iterating through the string and accumulating the net shift allows for applying all operations in a single pass."
