      "The problem can be broken down into two main parts: first, calculating the minimum distance of each cell to any thief (using BFS), and second, finding a path from start to end that maximizes this minimum distance.",
      "The Union-Find approach sorts cells by their safeness factor (distance to thief) in descending order and connects them. If the start and end cells become connected, the current safeness factor is the answer.",
      "Dijkstra's algorithm can be adapted by using a max-heap to prioritize paths with higher minimum safeness factors.",
      "Binary search on the safeness factor is also a viable approach. For a given safeness factor `x`, we check if a path exists where all cells have a distance to a thief of at least `x`."

      "The initial BFS correctly computes the minimum Manhattan distance from every cell to the nearest thief.",
      "Dijkstra's algorithm, when applied with a max-heap storing `(-safeness, cell)`, effectively finds the path that maximizes the minimum safeness encountered along the path.",
      "Marking visited cells in Dijkstra by setting their distance to -1 prevents cycles and redundant processing."
    ],
    [
      "The BFS pre-computation of distances to the nearest thief is crucial for all subsequent approaches.",
      "Binary searching on the answer (safeness factor) is efficient because the `check` function (which verifies path existence for a given safeness) is monotonic.",
      "The `check` function uses BFS to find if a path exists from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) using only cells with a safeness factor greater than or equal to the tested value."
