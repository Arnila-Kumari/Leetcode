      "This problem is a variation of finding the longest path in a DAG, but with three agents.",
      "The key is to realize that the paths of the three children can be thought of as layers or stages.",
      "The provided solution seems to be an attempt at a DP approach but has issues with correctly modeling the three children's paths simultaneously and handling overlaps.",
      "A more standard approach would involve a 3D DP state (child1_row, child1_col, child2_row, child2_col, child3_row, child3_col) or a state based on the total number of steps taken by each child."
