      "The state space is large (m * 2^n), requiring careful optimization and potentially bitmasking for representing subsets of individuals."

      "The state representation needs to capture the current stage, the location of the boat (base or destination), and the set of individuals already at the destination.",
      "The transitions involve sending groups or returning individuals, with stage updates based on travel time.",
      "The complexity arises from the exponential number of subsets of individuals, making it a typical bitmask DP or state-space search problem."
