      "Robots moving in the same direction will never collide. Collisions only happen between robots moving towards each other ('R' followed by 'L').",
      "Sorting robots by position allows us to process potential collisions sequentially. A stack is ideal for managing robots moving right, as they are the ones that will encounter left-moving robots.",
      "When a right-moving robot (on stack) encounters a left-moving robot (current iteration), compare their healths. The weaker one is eliminated, and the stronger one's health decreases. If healths are equal, both are eliminated."
