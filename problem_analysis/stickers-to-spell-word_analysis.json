    [
      "This is a classic dynamic programming problem where the state is the remaining target string.",
      "The transitions involve trying each sticker and seeing which letters it can cover in the current target.",
      "Memoization is crucial to avoid recomputing results for the same target substrings."
    ],
    [
      "The core idea is to reduce the problem to smaller subproblems: finding the minimum stickers for a shorter target string.",
      "The base case is an empty target string, which requires 0 stickers.",
      "If a sticker doesn't contribute any new letters to cover the first character of the target, it's skipped to avoid infinite recursion."
