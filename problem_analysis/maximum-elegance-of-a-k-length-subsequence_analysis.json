    [
      "The problem combines maximizing profit and distinct categories, suggesting a greedy approach.",
      "Initially, picking the k items with the highest profits is a good starting point.",
      "The challenge lies in handling duplicate categories within the top k and deciding when to swap them with items outside the top k but with new categories."
    ],
    [
      "Quick select can efficiently find the top k elements, reducing the initial sorting overhead.",
      "The greedy strategy involves maximizing the number of distinct categories while ensuring the total profit is also high.",
      "Careful management of duplicate categories and potential swaps is key to achieving the optimal solution."
    ],
    [
      "Sorting all items by profit in descending order simplifies the initial selection of the top k items.",
      "A stack can be used to keep track of profits of items with duplicate categories that might be swapped out.",
      "The greedy choice at each step is to either keep the current set of k items or swap out a low-profit duplicate category for a new, higher-profit item."
