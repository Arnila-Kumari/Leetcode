      "The problem requires processing subtrees. DFS is a natural fit for tree traversals.",
      "The first solution uses a top-down DFS, building the children list first, then recursively calculating sums and counts. It prunes by returning 0 count if sum is 0.",
      "The second solution is more efficient. It processes the tree bottom-up (implicitly via reversed iteration over nodes), accumulating sums and counts. If a node's value (after adding children's sums) becomes zero, its contribution to its parent's count is zero."
    ],
    [
      "The second solution leverages the fact that `parent[i] < i` for `i > 0` to process nodes in an order that ensures children are processed before parents.",
      "By iterating from `nodes-1` down to `1`, we ensure that `value[i]` already contains the sum of its subtree when we add it to `value[parent[i]]`.",
      "The `result` array tracks the number of nodes in the valid subtree rooted at each node. If `value[i]` becomes 0, `result[i]` is set to 0, effectively pruning that subtree."
