      "Using lambda functions for height access makes the monotonic stack logic reusable for both row and column traversals.",

      "The `count` function can be refactored to take an `add` function, allowing for more flexible result updates.",
      "The logic for popping elements from the stack and incrementing counts needs to precisely match the visibility rules.",
