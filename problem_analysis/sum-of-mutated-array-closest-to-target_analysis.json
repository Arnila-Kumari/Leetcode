      "Sorting the array allows for efficient greedy reduction of the target sum.",

      "The optimal `x` will be related to `target / len(remaining_array)`."

    [
      "The greedy approach of removing elements from the end of the sorted array simplifies the problem.",
      "The final calculation for the best value involves considering the remaining target and the count of remaining elements.",
      "The formula `(2*target + len(arr) - 1) // (2*len(arr))` or similar can be derived for optimal value."
