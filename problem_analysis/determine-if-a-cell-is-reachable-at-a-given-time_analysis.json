      "The minimum time to reach a cell `(fx, fy)` from `(sx, sy)` is the Manhattan distance: `abs(sx-fx) + abs(sy-fy)`.",
      "With 8-directional movement, the minimum time is `max(abs(sx-fx), abs(sy-fy))`.",
      "Any extra time `t - min_time` must be spent moving back and forth, which requires an even number of steps. Thus, `t` and `min_time` must have the same parity.",
      "A special case is when `sx == fx` and `sy == fy`. If `t == 0`, it's reachable. If `t == 1`, it's not reachable because you must move away and back.",
      "The condition `t >= mn if mn else t != 1` correctly handles these cases: `mn` is the minimum time, and if `mn` is 0 (start and end are the same), `t` must not be 1."
