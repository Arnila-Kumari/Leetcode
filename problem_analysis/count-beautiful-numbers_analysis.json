    [
      "The problem requires counting numbers with a specific property within a range, suggesting a digit DP approach.",
      "The core idea is to build numbers digit by digit and maintain the product and sum of digits.",
      "The divisibility condition `product % sum == 0` is checked at the end of number construction."
    ],
    [
      "The state space for the DP is roughly `(number of digits) * (max product) * (max sum) * (tight constraint)`. Max product can be large, but the sum of digits is limited.",
      "The provided solution's state `dp[b][(mul, total)]` implies `b` is the tight constraint, `mul` is the product, and `total` is the sum.",
      "The time complexity is dominated by the number of states and transitions. The number of digits is `log10(r)`, and the sum of digits is at most `9 * log10(r)`."
