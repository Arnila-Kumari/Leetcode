      "The problem can be modeled as finding a cycle in a linked list where array indices are nodes and values are pointers.",

      "The binary search approach leverages the pigeonhole principle: if count(x) > x, a duplicate must exist in [1, x]."

    [
      "The binary search approach requires careful handling of the count and range updates.",
      "The count of numbers less than or equal to `mid` is crucial for determining which half to search.",
      "The final answer is `left` because it's the smallest number for which `count(x) > x`."

    [
      "Marking visited elements by negating them is a common in-place technique.",
      "The absolute value is used to access the correct index, and the sign indicates if it's been seen.",
      "A second pass is needed to restore the original array if required, though not strictly necessary for finding the duplicate."
