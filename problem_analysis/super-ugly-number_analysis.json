      "The core idea is to generate super ugly numbers by multiplying previously found super ugly numbers with the given primes.",
      "A min-heap is crucial for efficiently retrieving the smallest next super ugly number.",
      "Maintaining pointers (indices) for each prime helps avoid redundant calculations and duplicate numbers."
    ],
    [
      "Using a set to store generated ugly numbers helps in quickly checking for duplicates before adding to the heap.",
      "This approach is conceptually similar to generating ugly numbers (problem 264), but generalized for multiple primes.",
      "The heap stores tuples of (next_ugly_number, prime_index) to track which prime generated it."
    ],
    [
      "The optimization of processing all equal minimum values from the heap at once reduces redundant heap operations.",
      "This approach ensures that for each step, we extract the smallest possible next super ugly number.",
      "The `while heap[0][0] == min_val:` loop is key to handling cases where multiple primes produce the same next ugly number."
    ],
    [
      "This solution avoids a heap by maintaining a list `ugly_by_prime` which always holds the next candidate number for each prime.",
      "The minimum of `ugly_by_prime` is the next super ugly number.",
      "After finding the minimum, the corresponding prime's candidate is updated by multiplying it with the next super ugly number it generated."
    ],
    [
      "This solution has a flaw in its logic: it pushes multiples of primes based on divisibility, which can lead to incorrect results and TLE.",
      "The condition `ugly_number % primes[i] == 0` is not sufficient to guarantee correct generation of super ugly numbers.",
      "The inner loop `for j in xrange(i + 1): heapq.heappush(heap, ugly_number * primes[j])` is problematic as it pushes too many numbers."
