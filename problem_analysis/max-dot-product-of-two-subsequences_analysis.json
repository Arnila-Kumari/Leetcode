      "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.",
      "The state `dp[i][j]` can represent the maximum dot product of subsequences ending at `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`."

      "The recurrence relation considers three possibilities: taking the current product `nums1[i]*nums2[j]`, adding it to the best previous product `dp[i-1][j-1]`, or not including the current elements.",
      "Space optimization is achieved by using only two rows of the DP table since the current row only depends on the previous row."
    ],
    [
      "The base cases and handling of negative products are crucial.",
      "The problem requires non-empty subsequences, so the DP table should be initialized appropriately, and the final result might need adjustment if all products are negative."
