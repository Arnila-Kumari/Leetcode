      "The operation effectively removes two characters of the same type if they can be 'matched' by a character in between.",
      "The key is to realize that for any character, we can perform operations until at most one instance of that character remains if its count is odd, or zero if its count is even.",
      "The problem simplifies to counting character frequencies and determining how many can be eliminated based on parity."

      "The core logic remains the same: count frequencies and check parity.",

      "The `sum(2 - x % 2 for x in cnt if x)` logic correctly calculates the minimum remaining characters for each character type."
