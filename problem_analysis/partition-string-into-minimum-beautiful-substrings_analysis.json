      "The DP approach can be implemented by iterating backwards to check for valid beautiful substrings ending at the current index.",
      "The constraint `s.length <= 15` suggests that an O(n^2) or O(n^3) solution might be acceptable.",
      "Careful handling of indices and base cases is crucial for DP correctness."
