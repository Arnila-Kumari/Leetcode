      "This iterative solution uses a stack to manage DFS. The state on the stack includes the parent, current node, and a temporary list to store results from children.",
      "The logic correctly accumulates time only for edges that are part of a path to an apple.",
      "The final result is `2 * (total_time_to_reach_apples - 1)` because the root itself doesn't require an edge traversal to reach, and we subtract 1 to avoid double counting the path from root to first apple."

      "The `extra` variable tracks if any apple exists in the current subtree.",
      "The logic correctly sums up the time for edges that are traversed to reach an apple and then return. The `max(dfs(...) - 1, 0)` handles the case where no apples are present or the root itself is the only node."
