      "The `next_popcount` function (from Hakmem 175) efficiently generates the next integer with the same number of set bits.",
      "This approach avoids iterating through all `n` indices if `k` is small or `n` is very large, making it faster in certain cases.",
      "The initial index `(1<<k)-1` is the smallest number with `k` set bits."

      "The simpler approach iterates through all indices `0` to `n-1`.",
      "For each index, it calculates its population count (number of set bits) using `bin(i)[1:].count('1')`.",
      "This is straightforward but can be less efficient than the `next_popcount` method if `n` is large and `k` is small.",
      "The time complexity is dominated by the popcount operation for each of the `n` indices."
