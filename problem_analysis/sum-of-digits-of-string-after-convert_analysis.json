      "The initial conversion involves mapping each character to its 1-based alphabet index and concatenating them.",
      "The 'transform' operation is a repeated sum of digits until a single digit is reached or k operations are done.",
      "The problem can be optimized by observing that the sum of digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9 (digital root property), but the problem requires k specific transformations."
