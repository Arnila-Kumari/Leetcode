      "The problem asks for the minimum 'k' such that the first 'k' queries can transform `nums` to zero. This suggests a binary search on 'k'.",
      "The `check(k)` function needs to verify if the first `k` queries are sufficient. This involves simulating the decrements. Since we can choose *how much* to decrement (up to `vali`), we want to maximize decrements to satisfy the largest `nums[i]` values first.",
      "A line sweep (difference array) is used within `check(k)`. For each query `[l, r, val]`, we add `val` to `events[l]` and subtract `val` from `events[r+1]`. The cumulative sum `curr` at index `i` represents the maximum possible decrement applied to `nums[i]` by the first `k` queries. We must ensure `nums[i] <= curr` for all `i`."
