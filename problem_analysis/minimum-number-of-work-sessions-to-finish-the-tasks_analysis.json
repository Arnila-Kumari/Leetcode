    [
      "The small constraint on N (up to 14) strongly suggests a bitmask DP approach.",
      "The state of the DP should represent which tasks have been completed.",
      "The transition involves trying to fit the next task into the current session or starting a new one.",
      "The first DP solution calculates total time, then derives sessions. The second DP directly tracks sessions and last session time."

    [
      "This problem is a variation of the bin packing problem.",
      "Bitmask DP is suitable for exploring subsets of tasks and their assignments to sessions.",
      "The DP state needs to capture not just completed tasks but also the state of the current session.",
      "The second DP state `dp[mask][1]` (remaining capacity) is crucial for making optimal decisions about starting new sessions."
