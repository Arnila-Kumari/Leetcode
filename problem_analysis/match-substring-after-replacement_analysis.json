      "The problem involves checking for a substring match with flexible character replacements.",

      "The core logic is to slide a window of 'sub's length across 's' and verify matches."

    [
      "Pre-processing the mappings into a more accessible structure (like a set of tuples or a 2D array) is key.",
      "The `transform` function helps normalize characters for easier comparison, especially when dealing with digits and letters.",
      "The `check` function efficiently verifies if a substring in `s` can be formed from `sub` using the mappings."
