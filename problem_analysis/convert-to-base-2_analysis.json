      "The core idea is similar to converting to any base, but with a negative base, remainders can be negative.",
      "The bitwise approach `-(N & 1)` and `-(N >> 1)` cleverly handles the negative base conversion.",
      "The result needs to be reversed as digits are generated from least significant to most significant."

      "The `divmod` function in Python is useful for base conversions.",
      "When the remainder `r` is negative, we adjust it by adding the base (`-2`) and incrementing the quotient (`N`).",
      "The resulting string should not have leading zeros unless it's just '0'."
