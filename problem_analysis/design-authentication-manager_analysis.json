      "An OrderedDict is ideal because it maintains insertion order, allowing for efficient removal of expired tokens from the beginning.",
      "The `__evict` helper function is crucial for maintaining the state of unexpired tokens by removing those whose expiry time has passed.",
      "The constraint that `currentTime` is strictly increasing simplifies the eviction process, as we only need to consider tokens expiring before the current time."
