      "The transition considers taking 1, 2, or 3 stones and calculates the score difference against the opponent's optimal play on the remaining stones."

    [
      "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where `dp[i]` stores the maximum score difference the current player can achieve from the subarray `stoneValue[i:]`.",
      "Since a player can take at most 3 stones, the DP state only depends on the next 3 states, allowing for space optimization using a rolling array of size 3.",
      "The base cases are handled by initializing the DP array with negative infinity, and the final result is determined by comparing `dp[0]` with 0."
