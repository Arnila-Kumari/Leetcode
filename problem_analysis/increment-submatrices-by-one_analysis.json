      "The core idea is to use a 2D difference array. For each query [r1, c1, r2, c2], we increment at (r1, c1), decrement at (r1, c2+1) and (r2+1, c1), and increment at (r2+1, c2+1).",
      "After marking all queries, we perform two passes of prefix sums (row-wise then column-wise) to propagate the increments.",
      "This avoids iterating through each cell of the submatrix for every query."
