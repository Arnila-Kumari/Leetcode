      "A hash map (like `collections.defaultdict`) is ideal for grouping rectangles by their simplified ratio. The key would be the tuple (simplified_width, simplified_height).",
      "Once counts for each ratio are obtained, the number of pairs for a ratio with count 'c' is c*(c-1)/2. Summing these up gives the total."
