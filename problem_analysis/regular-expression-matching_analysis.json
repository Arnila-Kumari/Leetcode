    [
      "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by considering subproblems.",
      "The '*' character introduces complexity, requiring consideration of zero or multiple matches of the preceding character.",
      "Space optimization for DP is possible by using only the previous row/state."
    ],
    [
      "The DP state `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.",
      "Transitions depend on whether the current pattern character is a literal, '.', or '*'.",
      "Base cases are crucial: empty string matching empty pattern, and handling '*' at the beginning of the pattern."
    ],
    [
      "The iterative approach uses pointers to track current positions in `s` and `p`.",
      "When a '*' is encountered, it stores the last matching position in `s` and `p` to allow backtracking.",
      "This approach avoids explicit DP table construction but simulates the logic."
    ],
    [
      "The recursive solution breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.",
      "Base cases handle empty patterns or strings.",
      "The '*' case involves two possibilities: matching zero of the preceding character or matching one or more."
