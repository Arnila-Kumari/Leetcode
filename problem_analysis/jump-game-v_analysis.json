      "The problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, suitable for DP.",

      "Sorting by value allows processing in an order that ensures DP states are computed before they are needed."

    [
      "The monotonic queue/stack helps identify the nearest valid previous jump candidates within distance 'd' that satisfy the value condition.",
      "A Segment Tree can optimize the query for the maximum DP value within the valid jump range.",
      "The key is to efficiently find `max(dp[j])` for valid `j` such that `i-d <= j < i` and `arr[i] < arr[j]`."
    ],
    [
      "The condition `arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j` is crucial and simplifies to finding the nearest smaller element to the left/right within distance `d`.",
      "The DP state `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of visited indices starting from index `i`.",
      "The transitions involve looking at valid previous indices `j` and taking `dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j])`."
