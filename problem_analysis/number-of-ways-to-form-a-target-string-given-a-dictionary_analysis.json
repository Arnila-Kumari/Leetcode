      "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to form the first `i` characters of the target string.",
      "When processing the `k`-th character of each word, we can use the pre-computed counts of each character at that position.",
      "The transition involves multiplying the ways to form the previous prefix of the target with the count of the required character at the current word column."
    ],
    [
      "This problem is a classic DP problem where the state depends on the prefix of the target string and the column of characters considered from the words.",
      "The constraint that characters must be chosen from increasing column indices is handled by iterating through word columns.",
      "Pre-calculating character counts for each column in the words significantly speeds up the DP transitions."
