      "The greedy strategy is to remove a digit if the next digit is smaller, as this will always lead to a smaller number.",
      "A stack is ideal for this: iterate through digits, and if the current digit is smaller than the top of the stack and we still have removals (k > 0), pop from the stack.",
      "After processing all digits, if k is still greater than 0, remove the last k digits from the stack (which will be the largest remaining ones)."

      "The solution uses a list `result` as a stack.",
      "The `while k and result and result[-1] > d:` loop implements the greedy removal of larger preceding digits.",
      "The `lstrip('0')[:-k or None]` handles leading zeros and any remaining removals if k was not fully used during the loop."
