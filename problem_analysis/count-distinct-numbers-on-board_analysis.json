      "The core operation is finding numbers `i` such that `x % i == 1`. This implies `i` must be a divisor of `x-1`.",
      "The process generates numbers `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., `2`. Any number `x` can generate `x-1` if `x % (x-1) == 1`.",
      "The problem simplifies to counting numbers from 2 to n, as all these can eventually be generated."
