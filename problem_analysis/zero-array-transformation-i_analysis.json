      "Each query `[l, r]` allows decrementing any subset of elements in that range. This means we can decrement any element `nums[i]` at most `k` times if it falls within `k` queries.",
      "The problem is equivalent to checking if `nums[i]` can be reduced to 0 by applying decrements. The total number of decrements applied to `nums[i]` must be exactly `nums[i]`.",
      "A line sweep approach using a difference array can efficiently track the *maximum possible* decrements applied to each index. If `nums[i]` is ever greater than the total decrements it can receive, it's impossible."
