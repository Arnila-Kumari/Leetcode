      "As we iterate through the input array, we place each number into the next available row that doesn't already contain it. This is managed by checking the current count of the number against the number of rows created so far.",
      "If a number's count equals the current number of rows, a new row is created for it."

      "This approach also uses a frequency map. It iteratively builds the result by taking all unique elements present in the current frequency map for a new row.",
      "After creating a row, the counts of the elements in that row are decremented. Elements with a count of zero are removed from the map.",
      "This continues until the frequency map is empty.",
      "This method is conceptually similar to the first one but structures the row creation differently."
