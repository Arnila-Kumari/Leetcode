      "The core idea is to use dynamic programming where the state includes the set of visited nodes (using a bitmask) and the last visited node.",
      "The constraint about jumping over intermediate nodes needs to be explicitly checked and handled by pre-calculating or dynamically checking which intermediate nodes are required.",
      "The problem can be broken down by length, and the total count is the sum of counts for lengths from m to n."
    ],
    [
      "This DP approach builds up solutions for longer patterns from shorter ones.",
      "The bitmask efficiently represents the set of visited keys, allowing for O(1) checks.",
      "The transitions consider all possible next moves from a current state, ensuring all valid patterns are counted."
    ],
    [
      "A recursive backtracking approach explores all possible paths.",
      "The time complexity is high due to the factorial nature of permutations, leading to Time Limit Exceeded.",
      "Memoization could potentially optimize backtracking, but the state space (visited mask and last node) is still large."
