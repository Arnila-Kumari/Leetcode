      "The problem has a monotonic property: if `x` tasks can be assigned, then `x-1` tasks can also be assigned.",
      "This allows for binary search on the number of tasks to assign.",
      "The `check` function needs to greedily assign the weakest workers (with or without pills) to the hardest possible tasks they can complete."
    ],
    [
      "Sorting both tasks and workers is essential for the greedy assignment strategy.",
      "Using `SortedList` or `bisect` on sorted lists allows for efficient searching and removal of assigned workers/tasks.",
      "The two main greedy strategies are: weakest worker to hardest task vs. hardest task to weakest worker."
    ],
    [
      "The `check` function's complexity is dominated by the sorting and the operations within the loop.",
      "The `bisect_right` and `pop` operations on `SortedList` are O(log m) and O(m) respectively, leading to O(m log m) or O(m^2) for the check.",
      "The provided solutions use `SortedList` or `bisect` which are efficient for this greedy assignment."
    ],
    [
      "The choice of which array to iterate over (tasks or workers) and which to search within (the other) affects the implementation details of the greedy assignment.",
      "The `check` function must correctly manage the available pills.",
      "The binary search range is from 0 (or 1) to `min(len(tasks), len(workers))`."
