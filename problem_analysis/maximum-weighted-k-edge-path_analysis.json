      "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming where the state represents the maximum path sum to a node using a certain number of edges.",
      "The DP state needs to track not just the node, but also the number of edges used and the total weight accumulated.",
      "Since the weight limit `t` is relatively small, we can use `t` as part of the DP state or as a bound for reachable sums."
