      "Sorting jobs in descending order can help prune the search space faster in backtracking.",
      "The `if counts[j] == 0: break` optimization is crucial: if a worker has 0 load, trying to assign the current job to another worker with 0 load is redundant due to symmetry."

      "This approach directly tries to find the minimum maximum workload without binary search.",
      "It explores all possible assignments of jobs to workers using recursion.",
      "The `result` array stores the minimum maximum workload found so far.",
      "Similar pruning optimizations apply here, like assigning to an empty worker only once."
