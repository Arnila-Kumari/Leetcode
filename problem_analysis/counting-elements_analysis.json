      "A hash set provides efficient O(1) average time complexity for checking the existence of `x + 1`.",

      "This is the most straightforward and often the most efficient approach for this problem."

    [
      "Sorting the array brings identical elements together and allows for checking `arr[i] + 1 == arr[i+1]`.",
      "A counter `l` is needed to track the occurrences of `arr[i]` to correctly add to the result when `arr[i] + 1` is found.",
      "This approach avoids extra space but has a higher time complexity due to sorting."
