    [
      "The problem has a small constraint on `n` (up to 7), suggesting an exponential time complexity solution like bitmasking.",
      "The state of the DP should capture which numbers have already been used.",
      "The transitions involve picking two unused numbers, calculating their score, and adding it to the score of the remaining numbers."
