      "The problem can be reframed as finding the maximum possible value `x` such that we can reduce all differences `d > x` to `x` using at most `k1 + k2` operations.",
      "Binary search is suitable for finding this optimal `x` because the feasibility of a given `x` is monotonic.",
      "Once `x` is found, we greedily reduce differences greater than `x` until the budget is exhausted, then square and sum the remaining differences."

      "The `check` function efficiently calculates the operations needed to reduce all differences greater than `x` to `x`.",
      "Sorting the differences initially helps in efficiently calculating the sum of reductions.",
      "The final step involves adjusting the remaining `k` operations to reduce the largest differences by one, and then squaring and summing."
