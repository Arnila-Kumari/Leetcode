      "This problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it suitable for dynamic programming.",
      "The DP state can be defined based on the number of operations performed and how many elements were taken from the left side of the `nums` array. `dp[i][j]` could represent the max score after `i` operations, taking `j` from the left."

      "The provided solution uses a space-optimized DP approach. `dp[i]` stores the maximum score after considering a certain number of multipliers, where `i` represents the number of elements taken from the left end of `nums`.",
      "The iteration is done in reverse for multipliers. For each multiplier, it calculates the new DP states by considering taking the current element from the left or right of the remaining `nums` subarray."
