      "The DP state can represent the maximum length of a consecutive sequence ending with the current number or the current number + 1.",

      "A hash map (defaultdict) is used to store DP states, mapping a number to the maximum consecutive sequence length ending with it.",
      "When processing `nums[i]`, we consider extending sequences ending at `nums[i]-1`, `nums[i]`, or `nums[i]+1`.",
      "The key insight is that `dp[x]` can be derived from `dp[x-1]` (if `x-1` was present) and `dp[x+1]` can be derived from `dp[x]`."

    [
      "This optimized DP approach directly calculates `dp[x+1]` based on `dp[x]` and `dp[x]` based on `dp[x-1]`.",
      "It efficiently captures the idea that if we have a sequence ending at `x`, we can extend it to `x+1`.",
      "The maximum value in the DP map after processing all numbers gives the final answer."
