      "Prefixing the length of each string allows for unambiguous decoding.",
      "Using a fixed-width representation for the length (e.g., 8 hex digits) simplifies parsing."

      "A delimiter character that is guaranteed not to appear in the strings can be used.",
      "However, if any character is possible, a length prefix is more robust.",
      "The provided solution uses a fixed-width length prefix, which is a common and effective approach."
