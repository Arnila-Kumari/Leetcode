      "A polygon is convex if all internal angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees.",
      "This can be checked by examining the 'turn' at each vertex. All turns must be in the same direction (either all left or all right).",
      "The cross product of two vectors (formed by consecutive edges) can determine the direction of the turn. A positive cross product indicates one turn direction, and a negative one indicates the other. A zero cross product means the points are collinear."
