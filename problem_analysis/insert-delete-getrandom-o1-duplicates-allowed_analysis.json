      "The core challenge is O(1) removal from a list. This is achieved by swapping the element to be removed with the last element and then popping the last element.",
      "A hash map is crucial to quickly find the index of an element to be removed, especially when duplicates exist. The map stores the value and a list of its indices.",
      "When an element is swapped, its index in the hash map needs to be updated to reflect its new position in the list."
