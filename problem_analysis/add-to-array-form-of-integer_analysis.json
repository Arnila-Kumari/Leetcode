      "The problem can be solved by treating the array `A` as a number and performing addition with `K`.",
      "It's efficient to reverse the array `A` and process it from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).",
      "The carry mechanism is similar to standard integer addition, and if `K` is larger than the number represented by `A`, new digits will be appended."
