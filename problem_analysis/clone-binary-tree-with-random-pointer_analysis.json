      "The node interleaving approach modifies the original tree temporarily to store copies, then restores it.",
      "It avoids the explicit use of a hash map by using the `next` pointer (or `left` in this case) to link original and copied nodes.",
      "Requires three passes: one to create copies, one to copy random pointers, and one to separate the trees."
    ],
    [
      "The recursive version of node interleaving follows the same logic but uses the call stack.",
      "It can be more concise but might hit recursion depth limits for very deep trees.",
      "The core idea of linking original and copied nodes remains the same."
    ],
    [
      "The hash map approach is more straightforward: map each original node to its copy.",
      "It handles null pointers gracefully by mapping `None` to `None`.",
      "This method is generally easier to understand and implement correctly."
    ],
    [
      "The recursive hash map approach is a common and clean way to traverse and copy trees.",
      "It naturally handles the tree structure and ensures all nodes and pointers are copied.",
      "The hash map acts as memoization, preventing redundant copying of nodes."
