      "The key is to identify when a new line segment begins. This happens when the slope between the current point and the previous point differs from the slope of the previous segment.",
      "To compare slopes accurately and avoid floating-point precision issues, we represent slopes as irreducible fractions (dy/dx) using the greatest common divisor (GCD)."
