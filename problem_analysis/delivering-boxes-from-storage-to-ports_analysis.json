      "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the minimum trips to deliver the first `i` boxes.",
      "The core idea is to find the optimal starting point `j` for the last trip that delivers boxes up to index `i`. This involves checking `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` constraints.",
      "A key observation is that a new trip is always needed when the ship moves to a different port than the previous box delivered in the same trip, or when capacity/weight limits are hit."

      "The provided solution uses a greedy approach combined with DP. `dp[i]` stores the minimum trips for the first `i` boxes.",
      "`left` pointer defines the start of the current window of boxes being considered for the last trip.",
      "The `cost` variable tracks the number of trips required for the current window, incrementing when the port changes. The `while` loop greedily shrinks the window from the left (`left++`) to satisfy constraints and minimize `cost`.",
      "The condition `dp[left+1] == dp[left]` is a crucial optimization: if the minimum trips to deliver up to `left` boxes is the same as delivering up to `left+1` boxes, it means box `left+1` was delivered in a separate trip, and we can potentially extend the current window further."
