      "The key insight for the first solution is that rotating the coordinate system by 45 degrees simplifies the visibility check. A mountain is defined by its base on the x-axis and its peak. The boundaries of a mountain `(x, y)` are `x-y` and `x+y`. Sorting by `x-y` and then `-(x+y)` helps identify mountains that might cover others.",
      "The second solution uses a monotonic stack. After sorting the peaks, it iterates through them. If a current peak is covered by the peak at the top of the stack, it's popped. Otherwise, the current peak is pushed. This ensures that only non-overlapping peaks remain."

      "The geometric transformation `(x, y) -> (x-y, x+y)` maps the mountain problem to finding points not dominated by others in a 2D plane.",
      "Sorting by the transformed coordinates is crucial for efficiently checking overlaps.",
      "A monotonic stack is a common technique for problems involving finding the next greater/smaller element or detecting overlaps."
