      "When considering `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (j < i), if `diff = nums[i] - nums[j]`, then any arithmetic subsequence ending at `j` with difference `diff` can be extended by `nums[i]`. The count `dp[j][diff]` contributes to `dp[i][diff]` and also to the total result if `dp[j][diff]` represents subsequences of length at least 2."
