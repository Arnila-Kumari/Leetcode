      "The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum sum of `n/3` non-adjacent elements in a circular array.",
      "This can be solved by considering two cases: either the first slice is taken, or it is not.",
      "Case 1: Don't take the first slice. This reduces to a linear DP problem on `slices[1:]`.",
      "Case 2: Take the first slice. This means we cannot take the second or the last slice, reducing to a linear DP problem on `slices[2:-1]`.",
      "The DP state `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum using `j` slices from the first `i` slices, with `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-2][j-1] + slices[i])`."

      "This solution uses space optimization for the DP by only keeping track of the previous two rows (or states) instead of the entire DP table.",
      "The modulo operator `%2` (or `%3` in Solution 2) is used to cycle through the DP states, reducing space complexity.",
      "The core DP recurrence `dp[i%2][j] = max(dp[(i-1)%2][j], dp[(i-2)%2][j-1] + slices[i])` remains the same, but it's applied with space-saving indexing."
