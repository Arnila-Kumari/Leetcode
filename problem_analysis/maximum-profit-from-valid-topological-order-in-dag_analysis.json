      "The constraint `n <= 22` strongly suggests an exponential time complexity solution, likely involving bitmasking.",

      "To transition to a new state `dp[mask | (1 << i)]`, we need to ensure that node `i` can be the next node in the topological order (i.e., all its prerequisites are in `mask`)."

      "The problem requires finding an optimal topological sort.",
      "The profit calculation `l * score[i]` means that nodes processed later contribute more to the total profit.",
