      "This problem is identical to 'maximum-value-sum-by-placing-three-rooks-i' in terms of logic and constraints, only the board dimensions differ.",

      "The heap-based approach efficiently prunes less optimal choices early on."
    ],
    [
      "The second solution provides a more compact way to achieve the same result as the first, leveraging Python's built-in `heapq` and `itertools` modules.",
      "The complexity arises from generating candidate cells and then checking combinations, which can be computationally intensive for larger k.",
      "The problem is essentially a form of maximum weight matching on a bipartite graph, but solved with a greedy/combinatorial approach."
