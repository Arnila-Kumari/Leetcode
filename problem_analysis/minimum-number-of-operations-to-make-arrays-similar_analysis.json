      "The operation `nums[i] += 2` and `nums[j] -= 2` preserves the sum of elements modulo 2 (parity).",
      "To make arrays similar, we need to match element frequencies. This means we need to transform elements in `nums` to match `target`.",
      "Sorting by parity ensures that we are pairing elements that can potentially be transformed into each other.",
      "The difference between a `nums` element and a `target` element must be even, as each operation changes the value by 2.",
      "The total number of operations is half the sum of absolute differences between corresponding sorted elements, divided by 2 again because each operation involves two elements."
