      "The key constraint is that swaps are only allowed between adjacent elements with the same number of set bits.",
      "This implies that elements with different bit counts cannot be directly swapped past each other.",
      "Therefore, the array can be sorted if and only if elements within each 'bit count group' can be sorted, and these groups maintain their relative order."

    [
      "The `groupby` function is ideal for partitioning the array based on the `popcount`.",
      "The condition `max(a) <= min(b)` ensures that elements from a group with fewer set bits do not appear after elements from a group with more set bits.",
      "This approach elegantly checks the sortability across different bit count partitions."
    ],
    [
      "Sorting each contiguous sub-array that shares the same popcount allows us to locally sort these groups.",
      "After sorting these sub-arrays in place, a final check ensures the entire array is sorted.",
      "This method directly simulates the allowed operations by sorting within groups."
