      "We can maintain a running count of available 'slots' for nodes. Initially, we have 1 slot (for the root).",
      "When we encounter a non-null node, we use one slot and create two new slots. When we encounter a null node, we use one slot.",
      "A valid serialization will end with exactly 0 slots remaining, and at no point should the number of slots become negative before the end."
