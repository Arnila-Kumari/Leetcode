      "The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where dp[i][j] indicates if s3[0...i+j-1] is an interleaving of s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1].",
      "Space optimization to O(m) is possible by noticing that dp[i][j] only depends on the previous row (or column).",

      "The DP state dp[i][j] represents whether the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 can interleave to form the first i+j characters of s3.",
      "Transitions consider taking the next character from s1 or s2 if it matches the corresponding character in s3.",
      "The final answer is dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]."
