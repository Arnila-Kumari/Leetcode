      "An edge exists between `i` and `j` if `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are 'close enough' (within `maxDiff`).",

      "If the count of breaks between two indices `i` and `j` is the same, it implies they are in the same connected component.",
      "This works because a break signifies a point where connectivity is lost, and if the number of such breaks is the same, the connectivity pattern is preserved."

      "Then, for each query `(u, v)`, we check if `find(u) == find(v)`."
