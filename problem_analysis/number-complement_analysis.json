      "The complement is found by XORing the number with a mask of all ones that has the same number of bits as the original number.",

      "String manipulation is a less efficient but more intuitive approach for understanding the bit flipping."
    ],
    [
      "The mask `i-1` where `i` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `num` effectively creates a sequence of ones matching `num`'s bit length.",
      "XORing `num` with this mask flips exactly the bits that are present in `num`.",
      "This approach avoids string conversions and is highly efficient."

    [
      "Directly manipulating the binary string representation is straightforward but less performant due to string operations.",
      "The length of the binary string determines the number of bits to consider for the complement.",
