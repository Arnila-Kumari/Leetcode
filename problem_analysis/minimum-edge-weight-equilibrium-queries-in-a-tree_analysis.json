      "The problem asks for the minimum number of edge weight changes on a path between two nodes `a` and `b` such that all edges on that path have the same weight.",
      "The optimal target weight for the path is the weight that appears most frequently on the path.",
      "The minimum number of operations is the total number of edges on the path minus the count of the most frequent edge weight on that path.",
      "This can be efficiently calculated using LCA and precomputed counts of each edge weight on the path from the root to each node. The count of a weight `w` on the path `a` to `b` is `count(w, root->a) + count(w, root->b) - 2 * count(w, root->LCA(a,b))`."

      "The first solution uses Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm, which processes queries during a single DFS traversal.",
      "The second solution uses binary lifting for online LCA queries, which requires precomputing ancestor information.",
      "Both solutions rely on pre-calculating `CNT[u][w]`, the count of edges with weight `w` on the path from the root to node `u`.",
      "The time complexity is dominated by the LCA computation and the processing of queries. The offline approach is generally faster if queries can be processed together."
