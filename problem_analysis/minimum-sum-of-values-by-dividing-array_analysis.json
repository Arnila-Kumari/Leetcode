      "A recursive approach with memoization can solve this, tracking current index, target index, and current AND mask.",
      "The state space can be large due to the mask, potentially leading to TLE if not optimized.",
      "The constraints on 'm' (up to 10) suggest that an exponential factor related to 'm' might be acceptable."
