      "The problem requires finding a starting amount that guarantees completion regardless of transaction order.",
      "A greedy approach works: sort transactions by cost. This ensures that when we need to spend money, we prioritize transactions that require less upfront.",
      "We need to track the minimum balance required at any point. If `cost > cashback`, we need `cost - cashback` more money to cover the net loss. The maximum such deficit across all transactions determines the minimum starting capital.",
      "The provided solution `sum(max(a-b, 0) for a, b in transactions)+max(a-max(a-b, 0) for a, b in transactions)` is a clever shortcut. `sum(max(a-b, 0))` calculates the total net cost (sum of positive differences between cost and cashback). `max(a-max(a-b, 0))` simplifies to `min(a, b)` for each transaction, and then `max` of these `min(a,b)` values represents the peak requirement. The sum of these two components gives the minimum starting money."
