      "The problem requires forming 3-digit numbers, so the first digit cannot be zero.",
      "The number must be even, meaning the last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.",
      "The frequency of each digit in the input array must be respected when forming the numbers."
    ],
    [
      "An iterative approach can be more efficient than backtracking by directly iterating through all possible 3-digit numbers and checking if they can be formed.",
      "Using a frequency map (like `collections.Counter`) is crucial for tracking available digits.",
      "The constraints on the number of digits (up to 100) and the limited range of digits (0-9) make brute-force or optimized iterative approaches feasible."
    ],
    [
      "Using a doubly linked list to manage digit counts allows for O(1) removal and insertion of digits during backtracking, which can be more efficient than array manipulation.",
      "The `dummy` node simplifies handling the head of the linked list.",
      "Careful management of the linked list pointers is necessary to maintain correctness."
    ],
    [
      "Sorting the digits and their counts before backtracking can help in generating results in a somewhat ordered manner, though a final sort is still needed.",
      "Dynamically removing and re-adding elements from the `digit_cnt` list during backtracking is a way to manage available digits.",
      "The `digit_cnt[-1]` swap trick is a common pattern for efficient removal from a list when order doesn't strictly matter for the remaining elements."
