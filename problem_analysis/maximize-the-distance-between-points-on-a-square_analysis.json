      "The `p[-1]-p[i] <= result*(k-1)` is a pruning step to avoid unnecessary binary searches."

      "Further optimization of the check function by extending the sorted points array to handle wrap-around cases more directly.",
      "The `bisect_left` is used with a limited `hi` parameter to search within a relevant portion of the extended array.",
      "This approach aims to simplify the logic for checking distances across the square's perimeter."
